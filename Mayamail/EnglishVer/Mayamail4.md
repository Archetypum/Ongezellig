sunday december 9th


I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT FOR GOD'S SAKE


i had been anticipating it for days and tonight she came into my room (without knocking of course) (luckily i was just simming this time) [TN: I truly don't know what she was "simulating", maybe she was making her bed creak at night]. i remember roughly what she said:


"so, next sunday is my birthday, and i couldn't choose who to invite to my party, so i just invited the whole class. at our home. i already know that everyone is coming, but not if you are yet, even though you live here naturally, but everyone is participating, so, if you would also participate i would really appreciate it"


this is just blackmail and she knows exactly what she is doing.


I thought out three scenarios in my head:


i go

pros: coco is not angry

cons: standing alone in a corner all the time, fear, humiliation, shame, not knowing what to do and say and bothering everyone with my presence


i don't go

pros: i don't go

cons: coco is veeeeeeeeeery angry and if i stay in my room (where else should i go) i have to hear how much fun everyone is having without that boring girl


i can't go

pros: i don't go and coco is not angry

cons: ???


i have a week to figure out how to stop myself from going. normally i'd use the bulimia method, but since my birthday she will suspect any of the excuse I use as me trying to get out of it.


unless...


i do something so crazy that no one would ever believe i did it on purpose...
