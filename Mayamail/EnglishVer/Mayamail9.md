hey maya, remember when you thought the christmas holidays would be fun once the the public holidays were over?

haha silly maya, if you don't come to school, school will come to you.

SO because school was closed and they couldn't use the music room, i was repeatedly treated to free rehearsals of coco's moronic band. i've always wanted to play an instrument but never did because the walls are too thin here. pippi would laugh at me and coco would try to help me all the time and i don't know which one is worse.

all four band members are in my class, but except for coco, i never remember their names. they make eurobeat folks because the guitarist really wanted to do something that no one has done before without thinking about whether it happens to sound good or not. i'm sure coco also realizes how bad the music is but she only joins in because they are her friends and she collects friends like they're stamps. is a friend still worth anything if you have so many? if i continue to avoid her, i can brag at christmas this year that i am the only one in the class who managed not to make friends with coco, which i think is much more impressive than hitting stuff with sticks.

the second worst moment was when i bumped into the bass player while going to the bathroom. i always listen by the walls before i go to see if the coast is clear, but she almost never says anything so i made a wrong guess. i opened my door and BOOM eye contact. greetings are my achilles' heel so i stood there like an idiot waiting for her to say hi first. she didn't and she just walked back into coco's room. rude bitch. she talks at least as little as i do, but somehow has friends and is in a band? do i look like i'm from chernobyl or something?

but the worst part was when they stayed over. i was still awake probably because of the eye contact incident so i had no choice. i would describe the night as being forced to listen to a five hour long live podcast by the most uninteresting presenters on the most unimportant topics. jesus christ friendship is overrated.


man...


if i had a band it'd be so much more fun...
