friday november 23rd


history today was about anne frank, i didn't like it but it gave me the idea to start a diary. writing down "alone and bored" every day gets boring quickly, so perhaps a weekly or monthly diary is better.


today the class came up with the brilliant idea to draw something together. must come up with a way out asap. pippi longstocking immediately refused because of her "faith"... can you be jealous of someone's stupidity?


that's all that happened today... now more than two months since my birthday. coco acts as if she didn't see anything, luckily, because she wouldn't have understood it anyways. can now never use the bulimia method again.


almost december... christmas is all about family so i will survive that, but the 16th falls on a weekend this year so she will probably take advantage of that - better be careful.


i don't know what else to write but this isn't important.
