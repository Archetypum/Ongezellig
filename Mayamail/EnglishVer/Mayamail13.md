ash wednesday

well then long story short:

so i got that 2nd rose, i was completely full of adrenaline and all, but then it turned out that coco had bought 1 rose for the entire class because she didn't want to leave anyone out and that 2nd rose also came from her as a kind of double consolation rose. that was a bit of a disappointment sooooo i tore them both apart oops

well it's better to do things like that in your revenge fantasies than in front of the entire class.

so coco would cook for us that evening and i had locked myself in my room. but instead of beating me up or at least starving me she just brought the food upstairs and apologized for ruining MY valentine's day.

then i felt even more guilty and decided that if she doesn't want to punish me, i'll do it myself. so i left her food alone that night and went to sleep quite hungry.

the next day was another school day among people who now hate me even more than before, so i skipped breakfast too and didn't bring lunch. all day i had too much stomachache to realize that i was maya, so that was already a better day than usual. i only ate again at dinner, but actually only because we sit at the table together and it would be too noticeable, but i felt guilty again when i was full so i also had dinner alone all weekend. and since then i don't want to break my streak so i've been doing this for three weeks. i've already lost weight from 44 to 40 kilos, but i always wear baggy clothing so no one will look.

and no, i am NOT anorexic because that's for THOTS who get insecure when they see the billboards. what i do is called FASTING, because that's what people from brabant are supposed to do after carnival to atone for their sins (i just needed a head start). and normally carnival makes me feel like vomiting, but that's not possible if you don't have anything to vomit ;d
