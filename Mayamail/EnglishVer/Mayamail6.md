sunday december 16th


this weekend i learnt that fantasizing about doing crazy things is much easier said than done


all week i was coming up with reasons to do it, but once i looked down all the reasons not to do it suddenly came up. i stood there for at least 5 minutes until i suddenly remembered what i should have thought of much earlier


what would coco think if i fell down the stairs?


and then i went back to my room


so tonight i've had to wait until she would finally invite me to join her. i had no energy left to come up with a plan so i just let it happen


last week i wrote this:


1. i go

pros: coco is not angry

cons: standing alone in a corner all the time, fear, humiliation, shame, not knowing what to do and say and bothering everyone with my presence

2. i don't go

pros: i don't go

cons: coco is veeeeeeeeeery angry and if i stay in my room (where else should i go) i have to hear how much fun everyone is having without that boring girl

3. i can't go

pros: i don't go and coco is not angry

cons: ???


deep down i hoped i was brave enough to go for option 1





it sounds very nice without that boring girl
