friday december 7th

wednesday was sinterklaas. only pippi longstocking and i did not participate in the class surprises (TN: during Sinterklaas it's tradition for classmates to open and exchange "klassensurprises" between each other). pippi STILL believes in sinterklaas and calls making surprises a sacrilege. when i explain that sinterklaas is a ruse she calls me a heretic and conspiracy theorist and that they said the same thing about the moon landing.

coco asked why i didn't participate in the surprises. i said i wasn't invited but apparently there were no invitations at all and everyone could come... she suggested sharing her surprise with me, but then we would both have 1 drumstick, so i said no.

in the evening we had to stage a "gifting evening" (TN: it refers to pakjesavond, the evening where Sinterklaas brings gifts to young children) to make pippi indulge in her illusions/happy. mom had asked in advance what kind of gifts i wanted, but all the things i really want are too embarrassing to let her buy them. so i asked for more kruidnoten (TN: probably the bag of food she has on her desk) so i can ration for the winter. according to my bmi i'm still underweight so it can't be that unhealthy. pippi now thinks that i have only been given kruidnoten because of my heresy and says that the Cabinet of the Jack of Spades will launch a new crusade to protect the true faith.

glad it's over, but i still don't know anything about the 16th...

i think it's the calm before the storm.
