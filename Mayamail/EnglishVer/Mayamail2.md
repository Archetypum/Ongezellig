friday november 30th


today we continued with anne frank. what i've learnt = anne was a beta, not very attractive and completely cut off from the outside world. i thought, hey, this is relatable and i almost sympathized


but then


"oh and she was hitting on the boy she was hiding with"


even anne frank had more experience than me... if they start persecuting eurasians, i might still have a chance


furthermore, i didn't worry about drawing with the others because they didn't even ask me to participate. actually i should be happy about that, but i'm not


to distract myself i started thinking about having sex while hiding and now i feel even worse. and then i noticed that it's already december and now i just want to hibernate
