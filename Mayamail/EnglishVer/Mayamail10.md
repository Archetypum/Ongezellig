monday january 28th

uhhhh if things continue like this, my weekly book will soon become a yearbook

i should have known that i couldn't keep it up every week. i once tried to learn japanese, within three days i knew all the hiragana and katakana by heart and i was full of motivation. but then kanji came along and i've never had motivation for it ever since. but i have a test in exactly 6 hours and i had to do something to delay studying so here i am again

nothing has happened since the holidays ended. at most when mom said grandpa and grandma are looking for a store assistant and i almost had a heart attack. the fact that i don't have to go outside after school is the only thing that keeps me from cutting or something. and i don't think a cashier girl with the aura of an aborted blobfish is of any use to them

but did she seriously think i was suitable for that job? then she's even less informed than i thought. but i guess your own daughter doesn't really matter anymore if you've bought two substitutes to compensate

not that i have mommy issues or anything, as if i'm waiting for another snooper like coco. as long as they leave me alone i have no reason to cut. anyways i never really understood self-harmers, i tried it once after reading about it but it mostly hurt. maybe i'm just not miserable enough

BUT NOT FOR LONG, because in just over two weeks the third most depressing day of the year will come, right after september 21st and the day school starts again. and yippeeeee it falls on a school day this year. if i start cutting myself everyday from now on, i'll probably have lost enough blood to be able to convincingly skip school haha
