after i am done writing i jump down the stairs

i don't think they will believe now that i did it on purpose. i've thought about everything so that the damage will be minimal and the result will be maximum. what i have to pay particular attention to is that my injuries are not too big to go to the emergency room, but big enough that i don't have to go to the party.

first i make sure i have a good excuse for why i "fell" down the stairs, so i wear shoes with loose laces that i "trip over".

of course, i'm not just going to jump down the stairs and let gravity do the rest! i make a controlled, careful dive so that i absorb the impact as much as possible with my arms. this will protect my head and hopefully give me some convincing scrapes and bruises so they can't suspect me of faking it. i try to thump as hard as possible with each step so that it sounds much more serious than it is. once at the bottom of the stairs i make sure they find me in a painful looking position. i certainly shouldn't complain about a headache, so they don't think i have a concussion and call 112. it is mainly my arms and legs that "hurt", making it difficult for me to move and "unfortunately" having to stay in bed all weekend.

of course, i can't stay home tomorrow because i can't "rest" during a busy party, so i ask mom to take me to grandma and grandpa's so i can "recover" there. once there i can relax all day with my phone, unlimited spring rolls and above all NO PARTY :D :D :D

and if i stick around a little longer, i might not even have to go to school next week and i'll have vacation a week early!! i haven't been able to sleep all week because of the panic attacks so i deserved it imo.

it's now or never... ahah so much adrenaline! but i've been preparing for this all week and literally anything is better than going to that party!


i'll write up tomorrow how it went! if i can live to tell the tale, haha
