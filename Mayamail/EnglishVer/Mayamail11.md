FUCK VALENTINE'S DAY

so every february our school holds a rose campaign (TN: they probably mean "school shop") where students can buy roses for each other that are then distributed on valentine

"hahahahha maya is jealous because she doesn't get roses"

you thought so bitch, i get one every year. not from a boy of course, but as a kind of consolation prize from coco because she gets about 10 roses every year and she probably felt sorry for me so she always buys me 1 too. also for pippi btw because otherwise she would get jealous lol

but the comfort rose is not the reason why valentine's day should be aborted from the calendar

yes, i know very well that this """"holiday"""" is just a fabrication of stores to sell nasty perfumes

DO I ALWAYS HOPE FOR MORE THAN 1 ROSE GVD

to avoid the inevitable disappointment i try to remind myself WHY i will never get more than 1 rose

and having to remind yourself for weeks

how boring and ugly you are

is so

terribly

tiring


hopefully everything will be back to normal after thursday
